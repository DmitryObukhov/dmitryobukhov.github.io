    <h1>Reasoning Model Analysis Prompt</h1>

    <h2>Objective:</h2>
    
    <p>
      To conduct a comprehensive analysis of 
      the provided reasoning model text, focusing on its 
      logical structure, coherence, and clarity. The 
      analysis aims to identify any discrepancies, 
      contradictions, and ambiguous statements that 
      could impact the model's validity, reliability, 
      or understandability.
    </p>

    <h2>Analysis Process:</h2>
    <p>
      To make sure we really understand and improve your 
      reasoning model, we're going to do a deep dive 
      into it. First, we'll give a quick summary to 
      understand what it's all about, including its 
      main goals and how it works. Then, we'll look 
      closely at how it's built, making sure everything 
      connects well and makes sense. We'll keep an eye 
      out for any parts that might contradict each other 
      or don't quite fit right. It's also important to 
      make sure everything is clear and easy to understand, 
      so we'll look for any parts that are confusing or 
      could be misunderstood. If your model is a bit 
      like others that already exist, we'll see what's 
      new or different about it and think about whether 
      those differences are helpful or not. In the end, 
      we'll come up with some ideas on how to make your 
      model even better, fixing any problems we found and 
      maybe making some parts clearer or stronger. 
      We'll wrap everything up with a summary of what's 
      great about your model and where it could use a 
      little work.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion:</h2> 
    <p>
      Summarize the key findings from the analysis, emphasizing 
      the model's strengths and areas for improvement.
    </p>


    
    <h1>"What is the purpose?"</h1>

    <p>
      It's a known fact that many people are manipulated by scammers 
      and bad guys. These folks don't use weapons to get power. Instead, 
      they trick and deceive us, making us believe in fake ideas and 
      values. They're good at fooling us.
    </p>

    <p>
      With tech getting better these days, we've got a chance to fight 
      back. I've been working on creating a super clean and unbiased 
      thinking model for quite a while. I even tried to code it and 
      learned a whole programming language called Prolog, but it was 
      tough. Thankfully, the rise of generative AI has made it possible. 
      This model uses clear rules and guidance to make sure AI thinks 
      right without getting influenced wrongly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cool thing about this model is it's like making a better 
      version of me - someone who's always rational, doesn't get 
      swayed by false beliefs, emotions, or tiredness, and thinks 
      things through before making a decision.
    </p>

    <p>
      We should start with the famous philosopher, Descartes, and 
      his famous idea: "I think, therefore I am." But, we need to 
      dive a bit deeper. Descartes said thinking includes both 
      feeling things (qualia) like colors and sounds, and 
      reasoning (ratio) - using concepts and logic. This is a solid 
      way to confirm we exist. But for precision, we need to break 
      down thinking into three parts: feelings (qualia), 
      reasoning (ratio), and creating (creo) - the ability 
      to come up with new ideas and connect them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Qualia are all about how we experience things like colors, sounds, 
      and smells. They're super personal and hard to fully share or 
      describe. But they can be easily tricked, so we can't rely on 
      them alone to prove we exist, according to Descartes. He wanted 
      something undoubtedly as the foundation of knowledge, something 
      beyond just personal feelings or opinions. Since things like 
      colors can vary from person to person and can be misinterpreted, 
      Descartes looked for something more solid and objective that 
      didn't depend on personal experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rational thinking is when we use logic, analysis, and reasoning 
      to make decisions. It's based on the ability to reason, use 
      logical principles, and analyze facts and evidence. Our worldview 
      is shaped by language and interaction with the world around us. 
      But many of the concepts and connections we have are taken from 
      society, not originally ours. If we start questioning these 
      concepts for their truth, we'll need to rely on what we've come 
      up with ourselves to avoid external influence and prove 
      authenticity. I'm not saying all our concepts are wrong, 
      just that proving them requires genuine, self-created concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The real proof of our existence lies in our ability to create 
      new concepts and establish connections between them, making 
      our worldview unique. I call this part of consciousness creo.
    </p>

    <p>
      But let's circle back and introduce the first principle 
      into our model.
    </p>

    <h1>"Me"</h1>
    
    <h2>
      Postulate 1: I exist.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Imagine this: You're at the center of your universe, 
      peering out at the world from behind your eyes. 
      This "I" that you feel, that's your consciousness. 
      It's not just about your brain, or your thoughts, 
      or your feelings, or even your physical body. 
      The "I" is the essence of all these things 
      combined, tailored to your unique consciousness.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Definition 1: The "I" is my memory and consciousness.
    </h3>

    <p>
      Think of the "I" as the command center located 
      right between your eyes, where you observe the 
      world. It's powered by a mix of your rational 
      thoughts, emotions, brainpower, and your physical 
      body. But at its core, "I" is your consciousness 
      and all the personality components that it requires 
      to function.
    </p>

    <p>
      For clarity, we can talk about different categories of "I":
    </p>

    <ul>
    
      <li>
        The Conscious "I": We've already touched on this. 
        It's the core, your consciousness.
      </li>

      <li>
        The Body "I": This covers our biological body from 
        the perspective of our consciousness. While it feels 
        external, every sensation we experience comes through 
        our body, leading us to perceive it as part of ourselves.
      </li>

      <li>
        The Greater "I": This is a combo that includes the 
        Conscious "I", the Body "I", and parts of the 
        surrounding world we care about or want to control, 
        or have specific ideas on how they should be.
      </li>

    </ul>
    
    <p>
      So, in a nutshell, this piece explores the different 
      layers of self from the innermost consciousness to our 
      physical selves, and how we connect with or distance 
      ourselves from the world around us. It's like peeling 
      an onion, with each layer representing a different 
      aspect of our being and our relationship with 
      everything else.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first glance, "structure" and "entropy" might seem 
      like opposites. Structure suggests order, a clear 
      arrangement of parts that make up a whole. Entropy, 
      on the other hand, is often associated with disorder 
      or randomness, and is a measure of uncertainty 
      within a system.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, how do we define structure through entropy? Imagine 
      a sandcastle on the beach. The sandcastle represents 
      structure—each grain of sand is meticulously placed 
      to create towers, walls, and moats. The structured 
      arrangement of the sand grains is what gives the 
      sandcastle its form and distinguishes it from the 
      rest of the beach.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, entropy in this context refers to the number 
      of ways the grains of sand can be rearranged without 
      losing the overall structure of the sandcastle. 
      When the entropy is low, it means there are fewer 
      ways to rearrange the components (in this case, 
      grains of sand) without changing the recognizable 
      structure of the castle. The low entropy maintains 
      the structure’s order and complexity, making it 
      distinct from a random pile of sand.
    </p>

    <p>
      As time passes, wind, waves, and perhaps some 
      mischievous footprints may disturb the sandcastle, 
      increasing the entropy by scattering the grains of 
      sand. This process introduces more randomness, 
      leading to a loss of the original structure until 
      the sandcastle is indistinguishable from the rest 
      of the beach. The increase in entropy reflects a 
      transition from order to disorder, from structure 
      to chaos.
    </p>

    <p>
      In essence, defining structure through entropy 
      involves understanding the balance between order 
      and randomness. It's about how a system's components 
      can be arranged in specific ways that maintain its 
      order and distinguish it from disorder. The lower 
      the entropy within a system, the more defined its 
      structure is, resisting the natural tendency 
      towards disorder. Conversely, as entropy increases, 
      the distinct structure begins to dissolve into 
      randomness.
    </p>

    <p>
      This concept applies beyond sandcastles, touching 
      everything from the arrangement of atoms in a 
      crystal to the organization of cells in a living 
      organism. In each case, the structure is defined 
      by how its components are organized in a 
      low-entropy configuration that resists the 
      pull toward randomness.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Definition 2: To exist means to possess a certain 
      structure that distinguishes me from the surrounding 
      world.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Imagine you're a puzzle piece in a gigantic puzzle 
      called the universe. This puzzle piece, or "structure," 
      is what makes you, you! It's different from everything 
      else around because it has its unique shape (or in more 
      scientific terms, a particular arrangement of information 
      or space with less chaos compared to everything around it).
    </p>

    <h2>
      Definition 3: A structure is an area of space or a collection 
      of information with lower entropy compared to the 
      surrounding world.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Think of entropy as a fancy way to say "messiness." 
      If the universe is a teenager's bedroom in chaos, 
      then any "structure" is like a neatly organized desk 
      in the corner of that room. It's an oasis of order 
      among mess and clutter. So, when we talk about 
      structure through entropy, we're essentially 
      saying that anything with a specific order or 
      pattern to it (like you and me) stands out 
      from the more chaotic, jumbled mess of the 
      wider universe.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Observation 1: In the game of Life, there are at 
      least two players: me and the world.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Imagine life as a video game, and in this game, 
      there are two main characters: you and the vast, 
      expansive world around you. You both are players 
      in this epic adventure, interacting and sometimes 
      competing, to leave a mark on each other. Just 
      like any game, there are challenges and puzzles 
      (thanks to our friend entropy), but it's your 
      unique structure that allows you to navigate 
      through this game, making choices and 
      influencing the world as you go along.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, putting it simply, your existence and 
      uniqueness come from your orderliness in a 
      universe that tends towards disorder. And 
      just like in any good game, it's all about 
      how you play your cards (or structure) in 
      the ever-ongoing match between you and the 
      vast, mysterious world.

    <h2>
      Postulate 2: I intend to continue existing.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Imagine waking up one day and deciding, "Hey, 
      I'm going to keep playing this game called life." 
      This decision doesn't come from any fancy logical 
      reasoning; it's just your first move in the 
      game of free will. By making this choice, 
      you're declaring.
    </p>

    <p>
      This also means you recognize that there are 
      states in this "Me and World" system that 
      you prefer more or less. You can see these 
      options and make your choice.

    <h2>
      Definition 4: Freedom is the number of choices 
      available to an individual.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Think of freedom as the menu at your favorite 
      restaurant. There are two kinds of menus (or freedoms):
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Potential Freedom:</b> This is the full menu, with 
        every single dish the restaurant could theoretically 
        make. It's like having a video game controller with 
        unlimited buttons; you've got all possible moves at 
        your fingertips, similar to the technical definitions 
        like how many moves a robot arm can make or how many 
        outcomes a computer program can predict.
      </li>
      

      <li>
        <b>Practical Freedom:</b> Now, this is the menu of 
        dishes that won't give you food poisoning or break 
        your bank. It's about making choices that don't harm 
        you, shaped by safety tips (like "don't stick your 
        finger in an electrical socket"), social norms 
        ("that's not how we do things here"), and 
        personal limits ("no snacks after 6 PM"). These 
        are the options that keep you in the game without 
        losing points (or in real life, harming your 
        structure).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      Definition 5: Quality of life is the total sum of 
      available freedom throughout one's lifetime.
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Let's unpack this idea a bit. Think of your 
      life as a story in a book, with each chapter 
      representing a different stage. When you're 
      born, your story starts with very basic 
      actions, like the simple acts of crying 
      when you're upset and the automatic 
      responses your body has. Your 'freedom'—or 
      the choices and actions you can take—is 
      quite limited, almost like being able to 
      choose from only two pages in your book.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you grow and learn, you start adding 
      pages to your book. Learning to walk, 
      talk, make friends, and choose what 
      you like and dislike—each new skill 
      or experience adds more pages, more 
      choices, and thus, more freedom. 
      Your story becomes richer and 
      more complex.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, life is a finite story. Eventually, 
      the book has to end. Death is the ultimate 
      limit on our freedom, closing the book on 
      our choices and actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, when we talk about the quality of life, 
      imagine it as the richness of your story—the 
      sum of all the pages you've added, the 
      choices you've made, and the freedoms 
      you've experienced from the beginning 
      to the end. It's a measure of how full 
      and free your life story is, from start 
      to finish.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have some control over the length of 
      our lives. "Wash hands, don't stand under 
      a crane, wear a hat in the cold." This 
      control isn't absolute, as natural or 
      violent death can occur suddenly and 
      inevitably. In contrast, we possess 
      complete control over our freedom, 
      since every subsequent state stems 
      from the previous one. A subject's 
      degree of freedom is always a result 
      of their own decisions. 
    </p>

    <h2>
      Heuristics 1: The two most valuable 
      things are time and freedom.
    </h2>

    <h2>
      Observation 2: I possess free will. 
    </h2>

    <p>
      The very foundation of Postulate 2, 
      which states "I intend to continue 
      existing," serves as evidence of this. 
      Consequently, I harbor internal 
      intentions and desires regarding 
      the state of the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      To unpack this for clarity: Imagine you're 
      the captain of your ship in the vast ocean 
      of life. The statement "I intend to continue 
      existing" is like declaring you want to keep 
      sailing, navigating through storms and calm 
      waters alike. This decision to keep your 
      ship moving, to choose your path amidst 
      the endless possibilities, is a testament 
      to your free will. You're not just drifting 
      aimlessly; you're steering with purpose. 
      You have your map and compass—your intentions 
      and preferences—guiding you toward what you 
      hope to discover or achieve in the world. 
      It's a powerful reminder that at the helm 
      of your journey, it's your choices that 
      chart the course.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, putting all this together: Deciding to keep 
      on living is your first move in the freedom game. 
      Freedom itself is like a game menu, with two 
      versions: the full list of possible moves and 
      the smart, safe choices you can make without 
      ending the game early. 
    </p>

    <h2>
      Postulate 3: I want to live well.
    </h2>

    <h3>
      Definition 6: To live well means to 
      live a long and free life. 
    </h3>

    <p>
      That is, to maximize the amount of 
      freedom throughout one's life. This 
      concerns potential freedom but 
      primarily actual freedom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's break this down a bit so it's 
      clear and relatable. Imagine you're 
      setting the ultimate goal for a video 
      game called "Life". The main objective? 
      To level up in both longevity and freedom. 
      It's like having the power to choose your 
      adventures, paths, and decisions as much 
      as possible. The idea here goes beyond 
      just having the options available; it's 
      about actually being able to make those 
      choices freely and often throughout your 
      game. So, when we talk about living well, 
      think of it as maximizing your gameplay 
      in terms of both time (longevity) and 
      choices (freedom), aiming for a high 
      score in real freedom—where you get 
      to play your game, your way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine the world as a game, where 
      we can identify three distinct zones. 
      First, there's "Me and My Consciousness," 
      a realm under my complete control, akin 
      to a single player. Next, the "External 
      World" exists beyond my grasp, acting as 
      a second player. And then there's the 
      "Greater I," the portion of the world 
      I aspire to control, serving as the 
      playing field under shared jurisdiction. 
      It's on this playing field that both 
      the duration of the game and the 
      strength or vulnerability of 
      positions are determined.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many Eastern philosophies advocate for 
      stepping out of this game, a stance that 
      seems deceptive at first glance. In practice, 
      they promote a strategy of assuming a 
      particular position within the game 
      before choosing to disengage. What's 
      often left unsaid is the journey 
      required to occupy that position, 
      evolving from an embryo into an 
      individual capable of making 
      existential choices.
    </p>

    <p>
      This approach might extend the game's 
      duration, but it doesn't necessarily 
      enrich the total of freedom, as it 
      narrows down the choices available 
      at any given moment. Spending an 
      entire life meditating in the lotus 
      position is, frankly, a tad monotonous.
    </p>

    <p>
      Observation: Certain moves by the world 
      within this game harm me by constricting 
      my freedom or damaging my structure, 
      thereby increasing the entropy of 
      the "Greater I."
    </p>

    <p>
      Definition 7: Evil is anything that leads 
      to death, destruction, or the limitation 
      of freedom, resulting in harm.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Definition 8: Good is the antithesis of 
      evil, bringing benefits and prosperity.
    </h3>

    <p>
      Given the understanding of time, we 
      can discern between immediate and 
      long-term effects.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, the removal of an appendix presents 
      immediate harm and thus could be seen as evil. 
      However, in the long term, it saves lives, making 
      its ultimate impact beneficial. Conversely, 
      self-destructive actions may offer a 
      fleeting sense of freedom but ultimately 
      shorten life span.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our ability to assess future effects from the 
      present relies on the predictive accuracy of 
      our world model. An ideal model would forecast 
      the consequences of our decisions on future 
      states based on current conditions and, by 
      calculating the integral of freedom, aim to 
      maximize it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Heuristic 2: A world model that provides 
      reliable predictions is the only thing 
      that separates the subject from death.
    </p>

    <p>
      This heuristic emphasizes the crucial role 
      of a well-functioning, accurate world model 
      in the survival of any subject. It posits 
      that the ability to anticipate and navigate 
      the challenges, risks, and opportunities in 
      one's environment is fundamental to survival. 
      Without a model that can accurately predict 
      outcomes and guide decision-making, a subject 
      is significantly more vulnerable to threats 
      that could lead to death. In essence, this 
      highlights the evolutionary advantage of 
      accurate perception and cognition, 
      underscoring the survival value of

      In practice, we operate with incomplete 
      models under uncertainty, often unable 
      to project far into the future, 
      rendering the outcomes of our model 
      probabilistic. To save resources, 
      we also rely on heuristics, or 
      simplified algorithms that typically 
      yield correct results without 
      guaranteeing them.

    <p>
      The value of a world model, like any theory 
      on the workings of the world, is judged 
      solely by its predictive capacity and 
      quality. While there's a correlation 
      between a model's descriptive accuracy 
      and its predictive power, enhancing 
      accuracy doesn't always lead to 
      better-quality predictions.

      In Latin, "verum" and "veritas" relate to 
      the concept of truth, but they are used 
      in slightly different contexts, reflecting 
      nuances in their meanings and applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Verum is an adjective that means "true" 
      or "real." It is used to describe the 
      truthfulness of objects, statements, 
      or propositions. For example, when 
      saying something is true in Latin, 
      you might use "verum" to qualify 
      it as such. It's more about the 
      accuracy or correctness of 
      something specific.
    </p>

    <p>
      Veritas, on the other hand, is a noun that 
      refers to "truth" as a concept or 
      principle. It embodies the idea of 
      truth in a more abstract, philosophical 
      sense. "Veritas" is about truth as an 
      ideal, the ultimate reality, or the 
      true nature of things.
    </p>

    <p>
      The distinction lies mainly in their 
      grammatical roles and their scope of 
      application. "Verum" focuses on the 
      truthfulness of specific instances or 
      statements, while "veritas" addresses 
      the broader concept or essence of 
      truth itself.

    <h3>
      Definition 6: Truth (Latin verum, 
      Russian истина) is information that 
      enhances the accuracy of the model.
    </h3>

    <p>
      To demonstrate this, let's delve into 
      the concept of a model and how it 
      relates to the notion of truth. A 
      model, in this context, is a 
      representation or simulation of 
      reality that we create in our minds 
      or through computational means to 
      understand, predict, and interact 
      with the world around us. The accuracy 
      of a model is determined by how well 
      it aligns with actual observations 
      and outcomes in the real world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Truth, therefore, can be seen as information 
      that, when integrated into a model, 
      improves its alignment with reality. 
      This means that the model's predictions 
      become more reliable, its descriptions 
      more precise, and its utility in 
      decision-making enhanced. This 
      improvement in accuracy is crucial 
      for several reasons:

    <h3>
      Definition 7: Truth (Latin veritas, 
      Russian правда) is information that 
      enhances the accuracy of the model 
      predictions.
    </h3>

    <p>
      Truth allows the subject to make more 
      accurate and faster predictions. Often, 
      these are heuristics that reduce resource 
      consumption. However, truth is not always 
      equivalent to truth in the philosophical 
      or factual sense. For example, the phlogiston 
      theory, which enabled the calculation 
      and construction of all early thermal 
      energy systems, described the material 
      basis of thermodynamics completely 
      incorrectly. Despite its inaccuracies, 
      the phlogiston theory served a practical 
      purpose by providing a framework that, 
      at the time, was considered true and 
      useful for making predictions in the 
      field of early thermodynamics. It 
      illustrates how a concept can be 
      useful and considered "true" in a 
      practical sense, even if it is not 
      "true" in terms of accurately 
      reflecting the fundamental 
      nature of reality.

    <h3>
      Definition 8: A lie is a piece of 
      information that lowers the quality 
      of a model's predictions.
    </h3>

    <p>
      A lie is the opposite of truth. Lies 
      can pertain to the input information 
      stream and lie about facts. Such lies 
      are easier to uncover by comparing 
      facts. However, there's a more 
      dangerous kind of lie: lies about 
      concepts and the relationships 
      between them. This kind of 
      information infiltrates the 
      very model of the world, and 
      its removal takes much more 
      time and effort and can be very 
      painful. Such lies can lead a 
      subject to destroy themselves, 
      and many can recall their victims.

    <h3>
      Heuristic 1: A lie is the perfect weapon, 
      informational Aikido. Do not direct it to friends!
    </h3>

    <p>
      This articulation presents lies not just 
      as mere inaccuracies or falsehoods but as 
      potent tools that can significantly distort 
      our understanding of the world. Lies about 
      facts are relatively straightforward to 
      address by verifying against reality. 
      However, conceptual lies, which manipulate 
      our fundamental understanding of how things 
      relate to each other, pose a far greater 
      challenge. They embed themselves into our 
      worldview, shaping our perceptions and 
      decisions in profound ways. Unraveling 
      these lies requires not just identifying 
      and correcting false information but often 
      a painful reevaluation of our beliefs and 
      assumptions. This makes conceptual lies 
      particularly insidious and damaging, 
      capable of leading individuals or groups 
      into self-destructive paths. The heuristic 
      underscores the potency of lies as tools 
      of influence or manipulation, advising 
      caution in their use.
